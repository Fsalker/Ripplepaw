        Warnings
#1 Stupid warning. or am i misunderstanding?

<tr v-for="room in roomArr">
    {{room}}
    <td v-for="key in room">
        {{key}}
    </td>
</tr>

[Vue warn]: Property or method "room" is not defined on the instance but referenced during render. Make sure that this property is reactive, either in the data option, or for class-based components, by initializing the property. See: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Declaring-Reactive-Properties.

        Flaws
#1 every single time we use "await query(con, 'select bla bla...'", query returns a promise.
    the promise can be rejected.
    the rejection SOMEHOW gets caught in serverHandler's block:
            API_HANDLER_FUNCTIONS[api_name](con, res, body).catch(e => { ... } )

#2 inputs appear before bootstrap-vue.js has been loaded. so, it takes about half a second before
the inputs move where they should be. damn...
